				<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
				<p>Our Story After working in the construction industry for over 7 years and experiencing first hand the challenges in procuring building materials and services, we had a vision. </p> <p>
				
				<p>Our vision was to simplify the home improvement industry and give the power of choice back to the homeowner/buyer. We set out to provide those seeking to build or improve their homes with an online marketplace to access the products they wanted, at the prices they would love and deliver them on time and directly to their doorstep. </p> 
				
				<p>Based in Nairobi, Kenya, Ejenzi is a leading online marketplace for building and construction materials and home improvement products. We connect homeowners directly to suppliers of home improvement products which eliminates heavy retail markups and makes for a much simpler and trusted shopping experience. </p>
